PERSES
======

A Python framework for automated small molecule free energy driven design.

``PERSES`` is a Python framework that uses `OpenMM <http://openmm.org>`_ for GPU-accelerated molecular design driven by alchemical free energy calculations.

Background
----------

Perses performs relative free energy calculations using a single topology method. Single topology methods are those where the two 'things' that are being compared are done so by generating a single object whose parameters are perturbed between a representation of thing A to thing B. Perses supports perturbations between small molecules (for relative binding or relative hydration free energy calculations) and protein residues (resistance mutations).

Setting up and running a perses calculations involves three main stages.

Determining the atom-mapping of ligand A onto ligand B to work out the 2D topology of the single-topology alchemical object. Herein, alchemical topologies, systems, geometries etc. will be referred to as *hybrid*. This is handled by a ``ProposalEngine``.

From this 2D hybrid topology, we then generate a 3D hybrid system. We use the input topology and coordinates for ligand A and the system and use RJMC to build in the atoms of ligand B. This is handled by a ``GeometryEngine``.

With the hybrid system and hybrid topology, it's possible to perform free energy calculations. Equilibrium methods such as REPEX and SAMS or non-equilibrium switching can be used. The method in which ligand A and ligand B are perturbed is handled by the ``LambdaProtocol``, and sampled using samplers such as ``HybridSAMSSampler`` and ``HybridRepexSampler``.
