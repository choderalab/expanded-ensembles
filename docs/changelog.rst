0.10.1 - Release
----------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Bug when trying to use the new ``RESTCapableHybridTopologyFactory`` in the small molecule pipeline -- fixed by not specifying a protocol, hence allowing the ``HybridCompatibilityMixin`` object to automatically handle it. Issue `#1039 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1039>`_ (PR `#1045 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1045>`_)
- Bug in ``create_endstates_from_real_systems()`` -- fixed by setting the global parameters for valence forces to the appropriate endstate. Also added tyk2 transformation test. Issue `#1041 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1041>`_ (PR `#1050 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1050>`_).
- Bug in the ``RESTCapableHybridTopologyFactory`` lifting expression -- fixed by separating the cutoff distance from the lifting distance. (PR `#1046 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1046>`_)
- Fix bug in ``RelativeFEPSetup`` that prevents user from controlling the padding when solvating for solvent phase calculations. (PR `#1053 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1053>`_)
- Bug in ``test_unsampled_endstate_energies_GPU`` and ``test_RESTCapableHybridTopologyFactory_energies_GPU`` -- fixed by removing unit-less ``rest_radius`` argument and using default instead. (PR `#1057 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1057>`_)

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Add flag ``transform_waters_into_ions_for_charge_changes`` for disabling the introduction of a counterion for charge changing transformations. Issue `#1004 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1004>`_ (PR `#1030 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1030>`_)
- Perses output yaml file now adds timestamp and ligands names information (for old and new ligands). Issue `#998 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/998>`_ (PR `#1052 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1052>`_).
- Protein mutation repex internal consistency tests to ensure convergence. So far only testing neutral transformations. Issue `#1044 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1044>`_ (PR `#1054 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1054>`_).

0.10.0 - Release
----------------

New command line interface (CLI), many enhancements for the API (especially the ``PointMutationExecutor``) and improved testing.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Bug in geometry engine's ``_determine_extra_torsions``: when ``topology_index_map``, which contains the atom indices involved in a particular torsion, is None -- fixed by not trying to add that torsion when ``topology_index_map`` is ``None``. (`#855 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/855>`_)
- Bug generated by changes upstream in the ``openmm`` package -- default method for calculating solvent padding changed, which resulted in smaller boxes. Fixed by adding more padding to the simulation box, it is now 1.1 nm. Openmm issue `#3502 <https://github.com/openmm/openmm/issues/3502>`_. Perses issue `#949 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/949>`_ (`#953 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/953>`_)
- Fixed energy bookkeeping in test of ``HybridTopologyFactory`` when a ring amino acid is involved in transformation. (`#969 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/969>`_)
- Avoid changing the global context cache behavior on module imports. Issue `#968 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/968>`_ (`#977 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/977>`_).
- Benchmark free energy plots now shift data to experimental mean. (`#981 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/981>`_)
- Skip introduction of counterion for charge changing mutations in vacuum and fix typo in the phase name in ``test_resume_protein_mutation_no_checkpoint`` (`#991 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/991>`_).
- Recovered logging capabilities respecting the ``LOGLEVEL`` environment variable. Issue `#1018 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1018>`_ (`#1032 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1032>`_).


Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improved continuous integration (CI) performance. (`#961 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/961>`_)
- ``PointMutationExecutor`` now accepts both solute and solvated PDBs (previously only accepted solute PDBs). (`#967 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/967>`_)
- Tests and examples are now using ``openff-2.0.0`` force field instead of ``openff-1.0.0``. (`#971 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/971>`_)
- Use names (instead of indices) for fetching the force components of a system, avoiding issues with force reordering upstream in ``openmm``. Issue `#993 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/993>`_ (`#976 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/976>`_ and `#1007 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1007>`_)
- Increase stability of simulations by decreasing the default hydrogen mass to 3 amu in the ``PointMutationExecutor``. Issue `#982 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/982>`_ (`#983 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/983>`_).
- Improved CI tests on both CPU and GPU. Better handling of temporary directories, closing opened reporter files when tests are finished, and using same environments for CPU and GPU (`#985 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/985>`_ `#989 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/989>`_ `#1012 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1012>`_)
- Performance increase when retrieving the old or new positions from the hybrid positions. Issue `#1005 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1005>`_ (`#1020 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1020>`_)
- Use of unique names for force components in ``HybridTopologyFactory`` (`#1022 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1022>`_).
- New function ``create_endstates_from_real_systems()`` for creating unsampled endstates for currently supported hybrid topology factories (`#1023 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1023>`_).
- Improve the readability and usability of ``PointMutationExecutor`` and updates how parameters are specified for solvation (`#1024 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1024>`_).

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Introduce ``RESTCapableHybridTopologyFactory``. Hybrid factory that allows for REST scaling, alchemical scaling, and 4th dimension softcore. So far, only working for protein mutations (`#848 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/848>`_ `#992 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/992>`_).
- New perses command line interface (CLI) ``perses-cli`` using ``click``. Allowing a more friendly interface for users. It tests the running environment, sets the platform for the simulation and allows interactive overriding arbitrary options in the input YAML file. Former ``perses-relative`` CLI entry point is now deprecated (`#972 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/972>`_ `#1021 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1021>`_ `#1027 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1027>`_).
- Support for handling charge changes (by transforming a water into a counterion) for both protein mutations and ligands transformations. `#862 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/862>`_ (`#973 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/973>`_).
- Hybrid topology factory class name can now be specified using the ``hybrid_topology_factory`` parameter in the input YAML file (`#988 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/988>`_).
- Introduce ``unsampled_endstates`` boolean option in input YAML file, which enables/disables creation of unsampled endstates with long-range sterics correction. Issue `#1033 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/1033>`_ (`#1037 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/1037>`_).
