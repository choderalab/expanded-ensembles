0.9.1 - Bugfix release
-----------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- (PR `#828 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/828>`_)
  Addresses (`issue #815 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/815>`_) by checking the potential energy of the proposed positions before generating the ``RepartitonedHybridTopologyFactory``.
- (PR `#809 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/809>`_) 
  The atom mapping facility was overhauled to address a bug in mapping rings (`#805 <https://github.com/choderalab/perses/issues/805>`_).
  Atom mapping is now handled via an ``AtomMapper`` factory that generates an ``AtomMapping`` class that localizes all relevant functionality.
